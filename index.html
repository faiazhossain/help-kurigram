        <h1 class="dt-heading">Our Plan</h1>
        <p class="dt-paragraph">
          We have three major plans of your donation. First we will assure food
          for a family, then we will assure secure living space and provide
          medical treatment.

            <p>
              Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a
              natural disaster such as flood. People can't cook food because
              they can't light fire. So we will give them secure food and that's
              our first concern.

            <img class="dp-tab-img" src="icons/shelter.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              As most of the houses are drowned under water so we will make
              higher shelter using bamboo from the surface. People can take
              shelter during this hard period.

            <img class="dp-tab-img" src="icons/medicine.svg" alt="" />
            <p>
              One of the major issue is people get affected of by Water-borne
              disease. We will provide them needed medicine and also doctor
              doctors treatment.
